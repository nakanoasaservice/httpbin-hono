# httpbin-hono

A [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/) implementation built with [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and deployed on Cloudflare Workers.

**🌐 Live Demo**: [httpbin-hono.naas.workers.dev](https://httpbin-hono.naas.workers.dev/)

httpbin is a simple HTTP Request & Response service, useful for testing HTTP clients and APIs. Special thanks to [Kenneth Reitz](https://www.kennethreitz.org/) for creating the original httpbin project. This implementation is inspired by and built upon the foundation of httpbin.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.3 or later)

## Installation

```bash
bun install
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:8787` (or the port specified by Wrangler).

## Deployment

### Deploy Manually

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

## Type Generation

For generating/synchronizing types based on your Worker configuration, run:

```bash
bun run cf-typegen
```

Pass the `Env` as generics when instantiating `Hono`:

```ts
// src/index.ts
const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Env }>()
```

## Code Quality

Check code quality with Biome:

```bash
bun run check
```

Auto-fix issues:

```bash
bun run check:fix
```

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, visit the root endpoint (`/`) to access the Swagger UI documentation, which provides an interactive interface to explore all available endpoints.
